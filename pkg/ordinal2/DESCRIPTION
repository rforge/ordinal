Description: This package implements cumulative link (mixed) models also known as ordered regression models, proportional odds models, proportional hazards models for grouped survival times and ordered logit/probit/... models. Estimation is via maximum likelihood and mixed models are fitted with the Laplace approximation. Multiple random effect terms are allowed and they may be nested, crossed or partially nested/crossed. Restrictions of symmetry and equidistance can be imposed on the thresholds (cut-points). Standard model methods are available (summary, anova, drop-methods, step, confint etc.) in addition to profile methods and slice methods for visualizing the likelihood function and checking convergence.
