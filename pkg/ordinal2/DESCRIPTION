Description: This package implements likelihood based models for
  ordinal (ordered categorical)
  data based on cumulative probabilities in the framework of
  cumulative 
  link (mixed) models. This includes the important proportional odds
  model, structured thresholds (cut-points) and random
  effects. Further, a range of estimation procedures and a range of
  auxiliary functions are implemented.
