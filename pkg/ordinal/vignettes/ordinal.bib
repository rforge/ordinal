 abstract = {Most discussions of ordinal variables in the
              sociological literature debate the suitability of
              linear regression and structural equation methods
              when some variables are ordinal. Largely ignored in
              these discussions are methods for ordinal variables
              that are natural extensions of probit and logit
              models for dichotomous variables. If ordinal
              variables are discrete realizations of unmeasured
              continuous variables, these methods allow one to
              include ordinal dependent and independent variables
              into structural equation models in a way that (1)
              explicitly recognizes their ordinality, (2) avoids
              arbitrary assumptions about their scale, and (3)
              allows for analysis of continuous, dichotomous, and
              ordinal variables within a common statistical
              framework. These models rely on assumed probability
              distributions of the continuous variables that
              underly the observed ordinal variables, but these
              assumptions are testable. The models can be
              estimated using a number of commonly used
              statistical programs. As is illustrated by an
              empirical example, ordered probit and logit models,
              like their dichotomous counterparts, take account of
              the ceiling and floor restrictions on models that
              include ordinal variables, whereas the linear
              regression model does not.},

 abstract = {For a very general regression model with an ordinal
              dependent variable, the log likelihood is proved
              concave if the derivative of the underlying response
              function has concave logarithm. For a binary
              dependent variable, a weaker condition suffices,
              namely, that the response function and its
              complement each have concave logarithm. The normal,
              logistic, sine, and extreme-value distributions,
              among others, satisfy the stronger condition, the t
              (including Cauchy) distributions only the
              weaker. Some converses and generalizations are also

              ordinary linear regression model with a continuous
              dependent variable that is partly unobservable,

              endpoints, or censored, or, more generally, grouped
              in some regions, censored in others, and observed
